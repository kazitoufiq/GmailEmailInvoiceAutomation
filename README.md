# Invoicing-automation-using-python

This is a project to automate the invoicing to customers for a small business I have been running for quite some time. 

1) A tamplate invoice in word document is manipulated by python script to update the invoice date, payment due date, subscription period, due amount etc. 

2) After the modification is comepleted, the word document is converted into pdf file. 

3) Once the pdf file is generted, an email (using gmail with python) to customer is sent out with the pdf invoice as attachement. Email body and subject line also gets updated based on invoice content.
